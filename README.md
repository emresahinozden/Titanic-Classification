Classification Study on Kaggle Titanic Data

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data "kaggle titanic data") gives us information on the passangers of Titanic. 
By that information, we will try to find a model to guess if the passanger survived or not.

Dataset consists of two parts: train and test. 
We will use the train part to work on and test part to evaluate the results of the work.

Dataset have the columns:

- survival: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

- sex: Sex
- Age: Age in years
- sibsp: # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
- parch: # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- ticket: Ticket number
- fare: Passenger fare
- cabin: Cabin number
